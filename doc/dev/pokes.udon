# Overview

Most pokes are event-specific and sent via an `$operation`. An operation
requires the event `$id` and an `$action` to be performed on the event.

Non-event-specific pokes take a `$dial`, which includes a `%find` and case
request/response options. `%find` is an external event search and
`%case-request`/`%case-response` are purely backend functions used to obtain
a remote scry endpoint's 'latest' revision number. This was included as a
workaround until this type of scrying is supported on the kernel level.

# `$dial`

### `%find`

Search for an external event; ~ for name will search for all `%public` and
`%private` events under a ship.

```
[%find =ship name=(unit term)]
```

### `%case-request`

Scry revision number request

```
[%case-request name=(unit term)]
```

At the time of writing, remote scry doesn't support latest revision number
scrying so we request the case to be sure we're getting the latest event data.

### `%case-response`

Scry revision number response

```
[%case-response case=(unit @ud) name=(unit term)]
```

If `case` is null it means the path in question is not discoverable or does not
exist.

# `$operation`

Act on an event

```
[=id =action]
```

## `$action`

An event's API

### `%create`

Create an event

```
[%create =event]
```

### `%delete`

Delete an event

```
[%delete ~]
```

### `%info`

Change event info (see `$sub-info` below)

```
[%info =sub-info]
```

### `%secret`

Change event secret

```
[%secret =secret]
```

### `%limit`

Change event limit

```
[%limit =limit]
```

### `%subscribe`

Subscribe to record updates. The frontend doesn\'t use this; only the backend
does. Subscriptions happen automatically as a result of passing one of the
actions below.

```
[%subscribe ~]
```

### `%invite`

Invite ships to an event

```
[%invite ships=(list ship)]
```

### `%register`

Register to an event. Guest ships will pass ~ for `who`; the host will include
the ship they want to register.

```
[%register who=(unit ship)]
```

### `%unregister`

Unregister from an event

```
[%unregister who=(unit ship)]
```

### `%punch`

Validate or revoke a ship's attendance status

```
[%punch ?(%verify %revoke) =ship]
```

## `$sub-info`

Modify event info; slotted into an `%info` action

```
[%title title=cord]
[%about about=(unit cord)]
[%moment =moment]
[%kind =kind]
[%latch =latch]
```
