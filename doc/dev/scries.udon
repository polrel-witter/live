The %live agent contains the following scry endpoints. Each result in a
`$demand` type, defined below each endpoint. References to 'host ship' and
'name' correlate to the event `$id`, which is defined in `/sur` as
`[=ship name=term]`.


# `%u scries`

`/event/exists/[host ship]/[name]` -> does an event exist?

```
[%event-exists p=?]
```

`/record/exists/[host ship]/[name]/[guest ship]` -> does a record exist?

```
[%record-exists p=?]
```

# `%x scries`

`/event/[host ship]/[name]` -> an event

```
[%event p=(unit event)]
```

`/record/[host ship]/[name]/[guest ship]` -> a record

```
[%record p=(unit record)]
```

`/counts/[host ship]/[name]` -> a map of record statuses with their cumulative
totals

```
[%counts p=(map _-.status @ud)]
```

`/events/all` -> a map of all events

```
[%all-events p=(map id event)]
```

`/records/all` -> a mip of all records

```
[%all-records p=(mip id ship record)]
```

`/records/[host ship]/[name]` -> a map of all records for a specific event

```
[%event-records p=(map ship record)]
```

# Remote scry

The `$info` for `%public` and `%private` events are published over remote scry
so others can find it. This is the data type that gets published:

```
[%remote-events p=(map id info)]
```
