The only subscriptions maintained are between host and guests to keep
`$records` in sync and a basic Eyre connection for the frontend.

`%live` uses Solid State Subscriptions for record syncing. The `$lake`
is below. It simply defines the `$rock` and `$wave` as a single `$record`.
These updates are processed in `%live`'s `+poke` arm, under the `%sss-on-rock`
branch
(see details on SSS [here](https://github.com/wicrum-wicrun/sss/blob/master/urbit/app/simple.hoon)).
We mostly just write these changes to our `$records` map after running a few
tests.

```
++  name  %live-records
+$  rock  =record
+$  wave  =record
++  wash
  |=  [=rock =wave]
  rock(record record.wave)
--
```
