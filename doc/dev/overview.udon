`%live` gives users a basic set of tools to organize an event (parties,
meetings, weddings, meetups, etc.). It's best approached from two perspectives:

## As a host

I can create an `$event`, which is static data stored in our state as an
`$events` map. It consists of the following:

- Basic info, which includes: title, description, a start and end date,
  the kind of event (public, private, or secret) and a latch (open, closed,
  over).
- An optional secret, which is a message only sent to `%registered` guests and
  those who `%attended`.
- A possible limit on the number of accepted registrants

Once an event is written to state, the host can begin building a guest list
(i.e. `$records`). They can do so in one of two ways: either by inviting ships
directly, or sharing their event link so that others can find it.

Event discoverability functions differently based on its `$kind`. Public and
Private events can be found through the search feature; Secret events are
hidden, so in this case, hosts must invite ships themselves.

Additionally, `$record` status changes will behave differently according to
these types. For Public events, anyone can send a register poke and get a
`%registered` status; for Private ones, their status will initiate to
`%requested` forcing the host to register them, unless of course the host
invites them first. As mentioned, Secret events are invite-only.

Finally, if a `$latch` is `%open` it means registrants are actively accepted;
`%closed` will default all `%register` pokes to a `%requested` status; and
`%over` means the event's been archived so any pokes (excluding a `$latch`
change) will fail.

## As a guest

With a record to an event, we'll have one of 5 statuses:

- `%invited` (a host sent us an event invite)
- `%requested` (requesting access to a private or closed event; subject to host
  approval)
- `%registered` (rsvp'd / will be attening)
- `%unregistered` (registration was revoked either by the host or guest themselves)
- `%attended` (we showed up; validated by the host)

A record will have the event info, and if we're also `%registered` or have an
`%attended` status, we\'ll have the host\'s secret.
